      "We'll start again and get going. Sorry to interrupt. Can everyone online hear us okay? Yeah, we're good. Perfectly. Thank you. Okay, we're going to jump back into it. Just a couple more sections left after lunch for the task 2.1, waterways and underground followed by powerhouse and then access roads and site facilities. Next up is waterways and underground. We'll talk about tunnels and shafts on the project. I'll take this one. On project phase B, next slide, what we noticed and I think Stantec did too was that the construction access tunnel obviously comes down to phase one nicely and in order to build phase two has to cross over phase one, so you're going to have to drill and shoot to get over that tunnel. Also, the same thing happens for the powerhouse access. So, conceptually, philosophy-wise, if we just drove the tunnel to phase two first and made that, do that tunnel, the southern tunnel and southern powerhouse first, phase two first, it could provide a benefit with a shorter tunnel later on for phase two and not even have to basically construct this and it also wouldn't impact the existing running facility. So, kind of conceptually, the idea is it's swapping over to phase two first if that's attractive enough and we understand, our understanding is that because of the, you know, the phase two powerhouse rock condition that it was said to go with phase one first. However, if we kind of focused on solving that problem, removing the phase two powerhouse, is it attractive enough on a program standpoint to do it and de-risk the overall program, but we would be targeting doing the phase two powerhouse. Now, if we switch over to chunk, the same kind of philosophy would hold and we would probably divide the northern tunnel and northern powerhouse as phase one so that you back yourself away from the existing running. So, more of a question and so we kind of, this was the concept we had, we had this over, so it was the phase one, phase one was the one, the southern phase two and we had the access tunnel exactly the way you described it, we didn't have this thing, it was only when the powerhouse became kind of critical and then we, at the end of the investigation, we found out there was a fault going through those pits and then would have another five or six months of critical path of building that powerhouse, so that is the switch, understanding that this would be an issue or a difficulty, we'd have to do this kind of, that was the reason why. Yeah, that's our exact question though, you hit it right on the head of, because we know the whole piece of the question is, is the schedule so critical versus the cost of exactly what you just said of five months, for example, because the additional line that's in the powerhouse two pits makes longer that, is there flexibility in the schedule or the schedule is a hard and fast, no, unless you can hit it in this timeline, but the extra costs for the extra tumbling on the adits is less important than hitting the schedule date, but that was exactly what you're saying with the question, because the reasoning makes sense why, but you can cut the holistic costs of the project down, but phase one may take longer, and is that palatable or not, yeah. I think what we would, what we would need is, I think it'll be this much reduction in cost, but it'll cost as much schedule impact, I think the determination of that, I think that was the, I mean, so it's, it's a risk-based decision, it's, you know, you want schedule risk or you want, that comes at a cost, but you want to, at the, yeah, makes sense. We can look at that, to get that answer, but that was the question, or it was just. And now we've, Christophe up next. Well, I will also say on that, in that the reason it is, why it is, because as 30% design was being developed, there was still uncertainty as to whether or not phase two was going to be constructed, it was, it was 30% design was to admit there was a, the idea was, if only phase one is constructed, it is preferable to construct it in the current sequence that we have right now, which is why we have the overlapping, why phase two is on the bottom. Does that make sense? Yeah. I mean, to your point, if you know you're doing two phases for sure, then that's where the question, when there was only one that, and maybe that makes more sense. Okay. You guys hear me okay? A little quiet there. A little quiet, I'll try to speak closer. This is not really a value improvement, but just a note that on the constructability side, we're looking at eventually reducing the gradient of the tunnels and prioritizing safety and productivity of the tunnels. We know it would add about a hundred feet of shaft, but we believe there's big advantages for the rest of the tunnel to look at such option. So you know, value improvement is not only cost, it's also general schedule and productivity and safety. So this will be a strategic decision that we'll take down the line after we do a little bit more risk assessment. So this was the inverse from your constructability, doing everything in that 10% grade, it does get the benefit of the shaft, but challenging underground work, it brings moisture that may be in there. Some pieces to it that it may be in this particular case worth generating more volumes for safer execution. Do we increase the waterways a bit, the headlosses? Correct. Yeah. Correct. Yeah. It'll be about an additional hundred feet of that shaft. Right. Yeah. Interesting. Yeah. Right. Okay. We have Selina up next to talk about directional drilling. Okay. I'm going to spend a bit of time, so forgive me if it feels laborious, but I feel like week talking to a bunch of different people, everyone's coming to table with a different association that we're using, and also the combination of the words that we're using. So what I want to hit here, even though we say that this is for the geotechnical investigation, it really isn't, there aren't two facets. The first one is what we have very literally called out in the description, which is directional drilling or for drilling for the GI. Directional meaning that the cutter bit is basically steerable. And that's what we've got in set there, sort of in the middle. And the advantage of this is you can basically collar from a location that allows for a downwards incline that will quickly get you to a surface alignment, which would ideally line up with the tunnel that you are going to construct eventually. And the advantage is we're collecting data along the alignment through which the required size is going to eventually be picked up and we get to see how, like what kind of rock we're going to encounter, what kind of ground conditions we're going to encounter, what are the structural features we'll encounter, how does the groundwater enter the opening or not enter the opening, all of those things, which would be very comparable to what's in the ground. And we can sample the core, we can run in-situ tests, like anchor testing for drilling, and also run an optical televiewer and get structural data. Hopefully the televiewer's got a caliper integrated, and we can collect the information on how the shape of the borehole will evolve from end to end. And that will also give us some, excuse me, some indication of how much the surrounding rock will form the borehole, but also some indications about the stress regime. And that's great because that helps us identify prevailing failure modes pretty quickly. So are we going to have more ground or crowned barriers on the sidewalls? How could the invert potentially behave or not? So those are all things that we could potentially glean from some of the in-situ instrumentation that we could run as we are doing the drilling with this technology. The second facet is once we go to construction and we're advancing the tunnel, because it's pretty standard practice now, and it is, I think, considered the best in this practice for our tunneling, is we acquire information ahead of the face. And this could be done with a number of different technologies, and the image that I've got in the bottom right is near and dear to my heart because I spent like a good five years in that little attic. It's a four-meter attic. It's for a nuclear waste repository in Switzerland. And that just shows you a drill rig that's fairly small. And part of the objective of that study was to collect information ahead of the face and also across the crown to help us understand how does that rock mass respond and how far away is that rock responding to the excavation. And that's sort of what we're trying to get when we want to drill ahead of the face during tunnel advance. And it also gives us the agility to basically modify for classes as we're seeing ground change from what we had initially. So the idea is to take all this information and develop those classes for the design aspect, and that hits the design observations, really in a vertical direction that just better aligns with the orientation that we're going to have to make. And we get to see the variability of the ground as we would anticipate or as we would expect to encounter it once we open it up on a panel scale. I think in the next year, tunneling and validating kind of the assumptions made during that process and then refining, always keep improving as we move forward. So at least you know what you're tunneling into. Right. It reduces the uncertainty and the risk, kind of like what Brett was just saying, more accurately defining the conditions ahead of us. For the GI, obviously the directional core drilling is limited. It's going to be dominantly different from what the ground conditions will encounter. So how far we can actually go, it is hard to nail down a specific number, even though I understand it's hard to nail it down. I think on our project team, we've had experience getting as far as 13 to 15. That's what those two red lines up to the right are roughly symbolizing. You know, we could try to launch from Three Mile Wash and we could also potentially try to launch from Arch and drill and hit those first couple of thousand. Because that section of ground is closest to surface, it's going to be where we expect the most damage, for lack of a better word, because you've got valley formation and any time you've got valley formation, you're going to have stress relaxation. We also have just in general geological context to Three Mile Wash. Again, the improved efficiency for adjusting support design and the approach that we use during construction to adjust on the fly, that's the ultimate goal. That's what that little red line symbolizes. Sorry, you said you can get like 13 to 1400 feet? That's based on our collective project experience. It's very much based on ground conditions, however much the ground will allow the cutterhead to move. The company that we've used, we've worked with the company before and other things, but not in this rig, they published that they could drill up to nearly 5,000 feet. I don't know how real that is. Well, that comes back to what are you in? Sands crushing that way? 20 feet under the ground. That's different. Understanding this rather than getting one point and then moving down 1,000 feet and getting one more point in that shaft. Understanding what it really is. Don't know if it would actually change the design at all, but it would help in getting better certainty in your construction execution approach with what you think you're encountering as you're advancing ahead of time to prepare more appropriately for it. I agree. There are obviously logistical issues with getting down to the depth of interest and all that kind of stuff. I think I can probably say there's a very, very, very low probability that we'll be able to do this in the 2025 program. We could take a look and see if the drilling subcontractors have capabilities. Some of this stuff, as you know, is specialized equipment, specialized contractors, stuff like that. So, yes, I agree. It would be nice to have. Not quite sure. We can take a look at it, but I don't think where we are with the current plan, it's going to be possible to do any directional type drilling or recovery. In this coming phase. Thank you. It's not common. Even if it's not in this equipment, the more we can get in this program to a point, it still helps from that validation if it fell into another program. It's de-risking the job if we can do it. Then it comes back to what's the cost of this specialty rig? Is it in North America? Those are the plays that come into place with it. I think one other benefit to this, although specialty contractor might be an expensive add, but you get a lot of information with potentially no need or minimal need for a helicopter setup or support. That could be a nice benefit. But will we do it here or at Shark Beach? That's a nice response. It's a nice little pull out area to set up.\n",

      "Already yeah Well, sir, I Happen to come down. We're already closer to it depends on we can send you some one company that we've talked to For another job about this or did it's a company BSL did not drill with that But we've used them to do other Other works as a as a compass. Yeah, that'd be interesting They have and we can move around. Hey, like I said, uh We'll we'll look into it. I just Knowing the permitting and other logistics. It's and Trying to get rid of out there in a month or so. It's it's not And you know It's in the graphic I mean, this is a long long hole just to get down to the area that you're interested in the first place So It's like going the 1,200 feet down till you get to the 30 feet of tunnel we Ideally No, we're not able to Elevation immediately. We're still going sub parallel Skew of an angle, but it's way better and this slide will will demonstrate that but it's way better than vertical So it's not lost information we were still very much interested in what kind of geology Rock mass domains we would be crossing even there because we will still be crossing that it would be lower Hopefully better because it's more confined. But um, this is just a published case study where It shows in the top what it would look like in terms of interpretations And Even with some inclined holes, like you're just always going to be limited due to a directional bias but you know when they introduce the Specific like I said, everybody's got different words for it. But um the directional core drilling the bottom image is what they they were able to interpret at the end of the day and it's just because Right, you're not able to really capture Features that are sort of aligned in the vertical direction like you won't be able to capture where that those vertical stratigraphic contacts Okay And in our particular case because all of our faults are sub vertical It's kind of like drilling sub vertically. You need to have the right inclination Pretty much To really be able to capture the full extent of the fault and because we've got the fault impact zone and Some of these fault structures are like I said like the geological processes that have That have been undertaken to generate that surface expression. We need to know what the widths are The ground support is going to be very different if it's fragmented, broken down, versus something that's globular versus something that's massive and compact And then we have to switch back and forth It's going to come into play in terms of like the tunneling technology or the methodology that we we land on That will all come that will all shake down to the stuff that they do not I Have so just again to reiterate like It's drilling in a different direction We're doing it also as part of the the construction we get data We want just from the core, but we can instrument we can we can log we can survey And it just it's just an enormous amount of it. It's all can say I don't know how to sell it better It's the direction. It's a relevant direction Because that's what we're going to live the underground cruising of a degree in this direction I think if all of this needs to be seen in the context of the class two estimate And it's all just to take the full certainty support classes Etc etc as you as you move into the tunnel what what conditions are expected And it's obviously quite valuable from from a design perspective But the focus is really get get you that last two and narrow the bands for the project or certainly Yep, I agree It was Right, so this one's me TBM tunnel we alluded to it slightly earlier on go to the next slide So BTJP is proposing that we Reconsider the use of a total boring machine to excavate the pressure tunnels on the project I'll just just stand up here so I can point out something on the screen as I go We Know this was considered As a potential means and methods for the tunnel excavation in TM6 I'll address some of those points a couple slides from here. But first I just wanted to kind of point out the overall Scheme that we're looking at as well as the key benefits that make us believe this is worth really considering So First off we looked at a few different options for where we could launch a TBM from and how we could align the tunnels if We do go forward thinking this is something to look into further as a value improvement option. We do have some additional Potential tweaks or options that we could make But we've gone with for this presentation the scheme that's the closest to the 30% design as it stands right now and the main Thing that we'd be implementing here These will be launching from the Chung Beach area. This would give us a nice Plenty of space and room to work with that's separate from the three mile wash location So that we don't impact any of the critical path operations with the powerhouse And then we'd be looking at actually using the TBM tunnel here that's coming around You know in a 900 foot radius It's true TBMs obviously can't turn as tight as a drill and blast tunnel Doing that we can reuse this tunnel as the powerhouse access tunnel so that not all of that excavation is just Wasted basically extra excavation and in fact, I'll get into it on the next page Don't skip yet Mario, but I'll get into it that we actually think it'll it's it's going to reduce the amount of excavation required for the tunnels Key benefits of using a tunnel boring machine that's improved tunnel advance rate You know, we're looking somewhere like an average of 40 or 50 feet per day Versus what I think 8 feet per day was in the estimate for drilling blast Is that right Matt? About right there. Yeah, so greatly improved advanced rate as I mentioned with the scheme We actually think we're going to greatly reduce the tunnel excavation volumes. I'll show that on the next page Improvements in safety and environmental and public impacts versus drilling blast I'll talk about that a little more on the next page as well Reduce ground disturbance. So this style of excavation Disturbs the ground less than drill blast so it could have improvements to the temporary and final lining design and improved button system Utilizing an electrically driven conveyor to take the tunnel spoils out from the tunnel face rather than using Basically all trucks and vehicles within the tunnel Key disadvantage. Everyone knows you have TBMs. They are expensive and they are a long lead time piece of equipment we do think that the reduced excavation volumes as well as some of these other benefits could very well make it worthwhile to still use the TBM and As long as we can place the order for a TBM by September 1st, 2027 We've looked at it. It won't impact the schedule. What type of machine would you be looking at? Maybe And what about the cost I didn't hear you how much more are we talking um You know roughly around I think we're looking at a similar size machine for a main beam rock machine somewhere between 35 40 million per machine, but that doesn't mean we're over blasting. No No We haven't ran the numbers to compare blabbing versus TV and what we suspect because she's gonna show you some yardage then That there's probably it's gonna be cheap. It's probably gonna be cheaper. Okay, is that a bullet? I have not had not ran those numbers Just the initial purchase of the machine. It's a high capital cost piece of equipment but we think that the cost would be offset by the other improvements that we're seeing here, especially the reduction in excavation yardage And schedule scale schedule acceleration So, yeah schedule acceleration, well actually first up you put the next one there Mario first one I talked about How we would be using we've located the powerhouse powerhouse access tunnel from Chunk Beach to three mile wash It's a little bit of a shorter distance, which is something that I know Stan tech was looking at as a potential being And then using the TVM has a little bit of a smaller Cross section than the original inside 33 foot drill blast excavation for that so we're looking at a reduction there of It doesn't net so a reduction in volume of 57,000 cubic yards for phase one. They're 29,000 phase two and then you can click the next one Mario Because of the faster exclamation rates with the tunnel boring machine We don't actually need a construction access tunnel. We can mine it from one end to the other Pullback the machine and then install the liners and So we eliminate that right there That's that's the biggest portion of the excavation reduction is the construction access tunnel just being gone 100,000 cubic yards phase one ninety two thousand cubic yards of phase two these right now. We're accounting for like a just for the Take off a nine inch over break on average It's included in this performance Understand so that that 100,000 92,000 that's the I guess that's the difference between going straight down and then the bed under first going I guess the rounded loop that you're talking about. Sorry. No, this is actually just the volume of this construction access tunnel for phase one I'm a 30% sign. I just a complete volume of that. Okay, we're not actually it was my same question yesterday I Used to explain to that that eliminates that's a reduction. Yeah, this was You don't need that. These ones are reduced From the TVM tunnel to the powerhouse, that's what they mean by reduction Erica we we explain the idea of things to After doing phase one Next sliders. Yeah, so Yeah, we think there would be a cost savings to phase one Maybe not a massive cost savings to phase one, but a real real benefit would be seen If phase two happened right after phase one because then you have all of the plant equipment set up And with the maybe rock machine, it's pretty standard and common to walk it back through the tunnel You won't need to disassemble it and bring it out through the pressure shop. We would walk it back We have a little cat relaunch cavern here. We'd walk the machine back Set it up for relaunch and then we Straightaway mine phase two and that could be done and left and you know independent. We don't do phase two Construction or if it was delayed for some reason, but it could be left and you know ready for later on And the vertical alignment Have you guys looked at at all in the issue being I guess the proximity to the I? guess Phase I guess maybe have you guys looked at horizontally and maybe that's what's wrong right now the way it's drawn you have about 75 feet clearance between this TBM tunnel showed in green and Becoming over top of the purple manifold for phase one And they're still Certainly a lot of drill and shoot work to do in conjunction with the TBM follow doesn't eliminate that but it's just a lot But all this is still drill and shoot for all the little little bits and pieces of the manifold there In schedule wise how I mean because With that main beam machine, I mean you're going in with the excavation you're backing it out You're going back in with formwork to the far end of the tunnel to do the lighting pulling that operation out Coming back in with the steel lining cans and doing doing that So you're you're tied to one heading with at least three major different operations So we would like to support Concrete lining of the tunnel from the pressure shaft and that's something that Brett will present a little bit on in conjunction with our means and methods for the pressure shaft lining actually right after this but So we'd be supporting that from that heading We we did schedule it out still with the concrete lining happening first and separate from the steel lining And we took a look at it. That was one location where the concrete lining we thought was a little bit Conservative in the schedule for the production rate. So we you have sped it up a little bit in our schedule that I'll show on the next page But even but even so Not very well, I'm sorry Good Get into that a little more on the next page if that's okay, just I'll just finish up real quick Just to finish up explaining the excavation volumes It's true cannot change the excavation diameter with the TBM So at first we thought it's probably gonna add a whole bunch of excavation volume because we can't I mean you can't actually Take that back. You can't adjust a main beam diameter, but it takes effort time you to stop. It's a procedure whether you do that or not, but when we actually looked at the high pressure tunnels and What the geometry of that excavation would look like with the TBM versus drill and blast and take it into account that there would be More over break with a drilling and blasting method than with a tunnel boring machine excavation. You can click next one now This is your 24 foot diameter steel line tunnel, and this is your 26 foot 6 inch diameter concrete line tunnel This is the same diameter circle here overlaid for a TBM excavation on top of here and you can see it There's just a little blue strip That would be your over excavation for TBM on your 24 foot lined steel tunnel And then these little yellow notes coming out are view of our excavation for having flat bottom of the drill and blast geometry So we actually found out, it surprised us Actually save a little bit of excavation even in that section on the pressure tunnels So overall when you look at all the phase one We reduced the excavation volume about 175,000 cubic yards phase two about 310,000 cubic yards and so that would be Taking all those trucks off the road All the incumbent benefits from that That much less explosives to handle and use and deliver to the project. I mean, we're looking at What type of explosive and what the actual dosage needs to be but somewhere between 200 and 500 tons of explosives project doing this So safety environmental benefits And then bringing the material out of the tunnel heading conveyor We're getting rid of a lot of moving vehicles hauling material out from the tunnels, which is a safety hazard and it will improve the air quality in the tunnel versus diesel equipment And then on the next page plus all the rock stabilization And over break that you got to deal with the drill and shoot that you've learned Yeah, we were just estimating over break on drill and shoot. So if that varies obviously it's less. I felt the onboard machining were pretty true So it's just a little image of a main beam rock tbm Um, and you know, we've space proofed out the area that we would need to be able to assemble and launch a machine from trump Beach, we think there's plenty of space there to do it um We're showing ourselves launching from a portal right now um Although there's consideration that maybe we put shaft in um, just depending on a couple factors Um, and then we have our schedule shown here which uh right now We're showing finishing the steel liner february 2032 Per phase one the tunnel boarding machine. So we think it's definitely possible with the schedule A couple of things we We've been working on Is that we've been working on Is that we've been working on\n",
      "\n",
      "know we know this was looked at before as a potential option. There was concern about increasing excavation volume because of the inability to greatly adjust the diameter of the machine. We talked about that a bit. I don't think that's an issue. The assembly and launch, you know, retrieving a machine from the shaft was noted as a disadvantage, but by walking the machine back through the tunnel, that's been mitigated. We will still need some drill and blast tunneling, and another thing that was mentioned was, you know, that there's not as many options for adjusting for an SEM excavation with a TBM. We will be able to implement any types of ground control and support measures that we could implement with the drill and blast tunnel. The main thing is that, you know, we wouldn't be able to excavate a partial piece at SEM direct with a TBM. The next page. And then, yeah, if we go to Chunk Beach, we would flip it and launch from Umawash instead, and we actually like this option better for the TBM as well. We can have a wider turning radius, which means the machine and the conveyor equipment would be less costly initially, and also all the spoils can be handled from Umawash, keeping them off of the patchy trail. You go straight up to the spoil area without hitting the road. Now, this also assumes that the TBM works perfectly, and you don't have to shut down to change bearings or anything like that. So isn't there a risk here with a TBM getting stuck, you know, problems with the equipment? I mean, compared to drill and blast, you know, there's a lot more flexibility to keep the excavation progress. If you've got a major problem with your TBM or your conveyance system, it's stopped, stop, stop. We do need to do some geotechnical investigation, and one of the things that we would plan to do with this machine to help avoid some of that issue would be to carry the probe and potentially even core drilling equipment on the machine to do pre-excavation probing and coring and map the geology in front of us as we go. But, you know, when we talk about 40, 50 foot average, that incorporates a lot of downtime. Obviously, the utilization on the machine is not 100 percent. So, I mean, we will have days that are double and potentially triple that. But with a TBM, the average, though, we could speculate in pretty safely in the 40 to 50 foot a day range up and up and talling. You're right. There could be a bearing failure or something that, you know, we would specify a new machine with a, you know, 10,000 hour bearing life and have a reasonable, you know, a very good chance of success with a tunnel boring machine that's, you know, clearly had been done before with a new machine. The difficulties, to your point about difficult ground, does pose a risk, but there are mitigations for that, including, you know, in the worst case, you have to drill and shoot around the machine and do SEM in front of the machine and then walk forward and relaunch and better. I mean, those are the extreme cases, but the more we get comfortable with the geology and stuff, the more we can feel like this is a good, a good idea, especially if you pull in a stage two tunnel with it, you have that capital cost, you can immediately go to work and get the stage two tunnel done. So, I hear you, Chris, loud and clear. I mean, the drill and blast is certainly flexible and convenient to get going, but this could potentially be a nice option. For the alternative to... I'll just do the question and answer thing and I'll work with both the powerhouses right there. Yeah, we were just saying that we're going right between them. We would probably either do that or just simply move that alignment down further and intercept the tunnel a little bit further down. This was showing kind of going through them, but if we were to push down a little bit, then you would just drill and shoot back. It wouldn't sweep that low. It wouldn't sweep that low. It depends on the geology. That makes sense. I'll just try a little bit of a last minute screen grab. One thing to note with this, too, because with the chunk, though, and then three mile, I don't think we have it on any of the slides, is ideally us taking stuff into three mile as far as spoils go even under drill and shoot and not taking it the other way where we're taking out of the access tunnel onto essentially Apache Trail, meaning putting chunk here and then even if this wasn't TVM and this was drill and shoot, we'd look to intercept these shafts from three mile, you know, the opposite side. And just like you had the access tunnel the opposite way, flipping it. The access tunnel would certainly be like this point and then we'd go both directions. Deep access tunnel is what we're looking at, how best to do that. But the fact is we're trying to putting it on chunk and then bringing it out of three mile with all your spoil helps us stay off the road. That's the benefit to it. So even if it wasn't TVM, we're trying to take the spoils as we're taking them out, not taking them onto chunk beach, because once you're in chunk beach, you're stuck on Apache Trail. That's the issue. It would be extremely strict. This elevation is probably 2050 or a bit more. You go down to 1700, so in a very short thing. So we had this as an option and found that to exceed. Talk about having for improvement of efficiency, seven percent. Here we go to about 15 percent. Unless you or extend if you want to have some acceptable grade. No, we would have to look at that. Either put a shaft and we do not want to exceed roughly 70 percent. So we would have to extend them so it's longer. Yes, we'll start lower. So the thought I noticed on this idea, but are you guys thinking for to do the chunk beach opposite the access from three mile wash fall that I guess similar and come in from the powerhouse area or would you go bid like STATDEC was thinking and then I guess be able to work in both directions? Yes, for drill and shoe we would come in higher, but we would want to pick a location for the portal that provided a reasonable grade to intercept the hull. Then like we said before, we'd probably work this side first and then give this as a base too. That makes sense. Then that way, we're going both ways. That's the most efficient that you guys picked up on that for sure. There is obviously still quite a bit to work through as chunk beach is I guess just an idea. So we've talked about using a similar area of the powerhouse for staging to offset chunk and as Brett said, but I think there's an awful lot of refinement that can be done if we buy into chunk beach and move forward with it because that area can be rationalised whether we use both powerhouses area, whether we don't, whether we use the supplemental staging area, all needs to be refined and then that plays back through to what elevation the portal will be and therefore where the portal will be. So I think there's a few more tunes to be played on that as we go through the remainder of the LNTP, but I guess the first premise was as an overall idea, it seemed to work of just swapping them over. I wanted to add that in terms of support and risk for the machine, the TBM would be equipped to do everything that drill and shoot can do or except shooting of course, aside from being able to do partial phase. And of course we're stuck with a full phase, but we'd have spilling, we'd have sets, bolts, outcrete, everything. Have you ever had projects where you drive an access tunnel and put a cavern in or a turntable in and drive a TBM one way and back it out and turn it around and drive it the other way as opposed to a big loop? And can be done too. They're doing this in the Alps right now. Yeah, but what you're saying is more direct straight shots to that long radius sweep versus it. Yeah, it all is the starting elevation and trying to get down to that grade. That's the challenge, right? It's just trying to lose that grade. The alternative is to use one of the pits. We actually like that. We like that option. I mean, it gets you launching from a better elevation early and it's a pit that's already needing to be built anyways. It's not adding a pit. The only downside of that is we would need more room. Well, and then all of your muck and everything's coming right to the location. It's a benefit because it's just a minimal amount of tunnel. We like it. We can mine from a shaft, no problem, but now everything's congested, including the pit. It's all simultaneous work. Yeah, so I mean, swapping makes sense. We kind of get the tunnel away from the tunnel. I think that's exactly what Stantec kind of arrived at with having the access over a chunk beach and same philosophy. Once we talk about the powerhouse section, we have a couple of ideas surrounding the powerhouse access tunnels as well, and that could play into how we want to handle if we also use the TBN, if we really are putting a powerhouse access tunnel in from across the way, or if it can be replaced by, for instance, a shaft, which we'll talk about later. You said that you would need to make a decision on this to purchase equipment or to get an order on our equipment. You're saying like October of 27 is when you all would have to make a decision on that? We were thinking place an order by September 1st, 27. And I would prefer like it's in the summer instead, but it depends. Part of it depends on what we're able to bring in on the powerhouse, i.e. the early works, but this is a later date rather than doing the early date, if you will, on the schedule. And the other thing was, if a decision was made by SRP that, you know, for whatever reason, hypothetical, that, you know, only phase one is advancing, would the TBN option still be something that you all would be considering? We'd definitely like to run it. Yeah, it makes it a lot easier, I think. I mean, it's, there's a lot of benefits out of the two tunnels with the single machine as opposed to the one just based on the length of tunnels. It's not very clearly to say, oh, yeah, the single TBN, because the purchase is so much and the first TBN is part of it. You know, and the huge advantage is just obviously eliminating that construction access tunnel. It's a lot of foot, right? And a lot of excavation. So we've got to run the numbers. We have to run all those productivity. So when we set these up in FragNets, when doing, I'll try one to your point, Chris, down one tunnel section, you have to do everything right. So we have to factor that in. So the tunneling is by far faster. And in that schedule we set out that Erica showed that we can get the other works in there. But we have to, if you saw that, us doing that quick at production rates, we need to set it out in detail to say, how much does it really take? Because now you're not talking about moving 2,000, 3,000 feet in that. From the one heading, you're talking about moving 5,000 feet every time, you know what I mean, for the initial works. So it is adding life to all the other follow-on activity that we've been stuck. Right. And other risks, like going back to my point, I'm not opposed to TBMs at all. But they do have, yeah, it's true. But it is, there are risks, there are, you know, and you're putting all your eggs in one basket, kind of, so to speak, in terms of excavation with that approach. But anyway, that risk element is something that would need to be considered as well. Next, I guess. Yeah, I guess so. Okay, so this is just discussing kind of a, we picked up on in the TM8, was the construction sequence and methodology for this deep shaft. And, you know, we agree that this should be on with it and sink as a blind sunk shaft, not a raised bore, because you'd be waiting for the tunnel to get all the way up to the end of the mountain before we could do the raised bore. So, blind sink the tunnel, that makes sense. And we looked at TM8 and Appendix G, seven-day calendar, shaft sinking was roughly 3 feet a day, and then sequentially aligned from the bottom up at 4.3 feet per day. So, we actually think that's, you know, pretty conservative. And the next slide would show that we do think there's an opportunity to align on the way down. And it's more of a means and methods, you know, question or proposal is, we would basically have a galloway in the shaft to sink that shaft and be able to muck, drill load, shoot muck inside of the galloway and then have the feature of being able to pour concrete on the way down with a curb stop at the bottom of that form. So, the form would keep sinking, that's part of the galloway system. So, we'd like to basically explore that and potentially be, you know, overall total savings on that 747 days that I just showed a minute ago. So, additional kind of stages and equipment purchase with the head frame, but for a deep shaft like this, it's been done before quite a bit, even in Arizona, the Resolution Copper, they did one of the deeper shafts in the country there. So, we know that's possible in a similar diameter. Neil, if you wanted to add anything to that. I think you've got it, Bert. The production rate, holistically, it will go faster. The production rate of your line would be less coming down, but you're getting to the finish line much sooner, right? So, it's not that 4.3 advancement like you're seeing, but you're able to do so much simultaneously with the pieces with it that you don't have to wait to get all the way to the bottom to start. So, while they're drilling, you know, drilling down here with the drill jumbo, it could be tying rebar, getting ready for the next pour. Obviously, when we're going to pour, it's probably all hands on deck for that, but you get to pour over with, and we can keep going with the cycle. So, the total cycle would be kind of sped up. How long are the, I mean, how big of pour sections would you guys do in that? It's probably 20 foot, and so you're, you know, you get, let's say you did two 10-foot shaft cycles to, you know, you take two 10-foot rounds in the shaft and then do a 22-foot pour. We'd have to try to balance it and make sure it all kind of worked together and made sense. That's the kind of the optimization of that. Okay. All right. Great. Thanks, Brett. So, just a couple quick slides here on some of the estimate observations for the underground portion of the job. If you go to the next slide, and the first one is about the pressure shaft up-down that Brett was just talking about here. You see pictures of what we...\n",
      "\n",
      "we would envision being near the surface as a headframe to support the shaft sinking operation. And what I find in the estimate is just, there's not enough time in there to do this type of work. Now that could be to the point with not knowing the details, the 444 day duration that's in there, could be a hundred days of that is dedicated to mobilization and demobilization. I don't know, but that's just not clear. I didn't see anything in there for demobilizing all that equipment and kind of the newer looking one is more like what we'd see. Similarly on the shaft lining side, there's a 500 hours there to put the forms together. I didn't see anything for taking them apart to get a terminal apart, get them up to 1300 foot deep shaft, that kind of truck and shipped over to phase two. So my comments on that, here's a significant amount of infrastructure required on surface to keep this operation going and to make it efficient and effective. Again, you can kind of see what's happening in the pictures on the right hand side, big head frame, all those have foundations. You're going to be a heavy duty collar on there, potentially some weather protection of your equipment and the witch house as well. And then the Galloway that Brett showed, you'll see another picture of that later. We've obviously got to put that together, take it apart. I didn't see anything in there for that. And similarly with the lining form, I think I've got a picture in here later of about a shaft similar in size, what that shaft form looks like. It takes a little effort to put it together, take it apart. Any questions on that? Okay, so the next slide here is about actual drill and shoot in the tunnel. And there's a bunch of numbers on there, but at the end of the day, I think that our expectations for the hourly production for drill and shoot in a tunnel are very similar. We're probably just a little bit slower. So there's not a whole lot to talk about here. I mean, this is a big activity on the job, so it's good to see some alignment there. My only real question with this scope of work, which I called the tunnel drill and shoot, that's worth its temporary support of the rock, is how the shotcrete is being made and delivered. There's just money in there. And all the other concrete items on the job had a batch and a deliver. And this is just money for shotcrete. So it's kind of hard to tell, was the intent to make central mix, wet mix and deliver, or to use dry mix? You know, that's just not clear. So we'd have to make the right decision there for the job. Any questions on that? Yeah, I have a question. Maybe we can get back to it at the end of an open discussion. It goes back to the original comment about the overall, you know, cost estimates and, you know, your opinions on where it was. I think you made a comment to the fact that you were about 30%. It was within a class three range, but something about being, you know, 30%, you would be about 30% higher. If that was my correct assumption. But is there a component of the project? We've got it broken down. We've been discussing powerhouse, tunnels, dams. Is there an area where you see, you know, some things, you know- Largest variance. The largest variance, or is it pretty much across the board? No, I think there are ups and downs. I think there is a table in the write-up specifically that does that, breaks it out by five different things. And at the end of that table, it's 30% more. And the biggest single item I alluded to it earlier was the rock excavation, was drill and shoot. It just were, our history is just slower than that. And it's huge quantity. So the number is big. Rock excavation in general, or is there a differentiation between shaft and tunnel or- No, it's the kind of the surface stuff. The underground is pretty close. It's really, it's the big mass X for the dam and the interconnect channel to get the dam materials. Okay. If you want to talk about it, I'd love to talk about all those details, whenever you want. I'm not a cost estimator. I know where to stand my lanes. What slide are we on here? Okay, so this is surface and shaft support. Surface and tunnel, start over again. Tunnel and shaft surface support. I didn't see a lot in the estimate here for, when we're sinking a shaft or mining a tunnel, there's a little bit of facilities in the estimate shown, a little bit of plant, not a whole lot. I didn't see any surface labor to support that activity. Similar for the lining works, both the concrete and the steel lining, recognizing the steel lining was subcontracted in the estimate. I just didn't see any support identified for that. And I guess what we would expect to see, this is similar to my comment earlier about overall indirects and overhead field labor. There will be people there and equipment there to support the work. There's going to be a top lender, the guy in the crane or a person running the crane. They're going to be there to load muck. In addition, there's going to be certain amount of facilities that are required, right? We need temporary utilities to do all this work. There's going to be compressed air. We've got to provide proper ventilation. We've got to get the dirty water out. We've got to treat it, get rid of it. We've got to bring clean water in, communications and lighting as well. That all needs to be provided. Similarly, we're going to have to do that for if there is a subcontractor in there, bring it in a big penstock pipe. We're going to have to provide all those services for that individual as well. I didn't see an allowance in there for that. That's just an important point. Because the ratio of the indirects was a bit lower than what we experienced in general. And then if you say, well, the sub, it's subbed. Don't worry. That doesn't work with IE, lighting, ventilation with it, the water, like you said, we're going to have to have a treatment for the project, not for that works in that area, not independent people because it becomes a mess. So we find this just on a bunch of jobs is that all those indirect support services become, quote unquote, we actually call them that common services for which we're supporting subcontractors in it too, because you can't have everybody doing their own program because it doesn't logistically work in the footprints with it. They're not independent projects because you're all using the same access pieces. And that may be why we're seeing on some of the indirects just low holistically, because we also know that we're having to factor in elements of the indirects for subs. That doesn't mean they're PPE, right? They bring their PPE that's in there, their parts to it. But those common services for the whole program, the roads we're maintaining in that, we're doing it for everybody, not ourselves. That's where we find it just to, and it may be in there, but that's where we can't see. And that may be one of the reasons why the indirects is a bit lower than what we. Right, actually there was a, there should have been another asterisk on this slide. Some of the information that was provided last night kind of alludes to some of those things you're just talking about there. Well, it may be covered in other places. I think that is our last slide on waterways and underground. At least that's what my notes say. If there's any additional questions on that, we take them now. If not, Erica's going to talk about powerhouses. Yeah, actually, I'm not going to talk very long about powerhouses other than say, we're going to talk about powerhouses now. And I will hand it over to Neil to kick things off. Well, this is really quick. We still need to claw back time. You start early, you finish early. I think that's fundamentally it. So the powerhouse is the critical path, the surface excavation adjacent to Apache Trail is the first element of work. And currently in the schedule that's held out until the main civils contractor mobilizes and commences on site. I think there is, I forget the numbers now, and I don't, 18 months effectively from the start of the early works until the start of the surface excavation for the main civils. There's a synergy between the two elements of work. It's fuel and blast excavation for the surface, excavation of the powerhouse. And there will also be similar excavation in and around the roads for the Apache Trail improvements, predominantly Apache Trail North. And so there are synergies with the work. So pretty simple. The sooner you start, the sooner you finish, and it hopefully can help some of the concerns that we may have had elsewhere within the schedule. I guess the only downside is it's quite a chunk of work. It's quite visible. And so setting that one off right out of the door, there may be some concerns with that. Those certainly, as we've looked at the early work schedule, there may be some work in reshuffling or re-spreading some of the early works. So some of the roads away from the critical path activities could be deferred or started a little bit later. That would help kind of rationalize the resources across the early works, and also may mitigate some of that big bang of an awful lot of activities going off at the same time. No pun intended. The early works program may take longer is what we're saying overall, but be better for the project by really focusing on the early works that we need to support the critical path, main civil works, sooner and not out with it. Right, that's the worst case scenario. I'm not actually convinced the early works would go actually longer because the way the early works seem to be structured in the schedule is there's a lot of roads that are front loaded. And so everything seems to be working all at the same time. And I think it's more about re-spreading those resources around. And I'd like to run the numbers properly, but I think he probably could be squeezed into a similar sort of timeframe. We had talks and had quite a bit of deliberation on putting surface excavation components into early works, top beach, portal, phase one powerhouse, two powerhouse and stuff like that. And I don't know, I'm not sure you can weigh in on it as well. But I mean, I think one of the reasons that for the time being we made the assumption that those large surface excavations would be at civil works is, well, one of the reasons is because, there's obviously a risk and an interface issue. If you have a roadworks contractor excavate a big slope, and then now you guys are going to come in and build within that. I mean, what they excavate is not going to be a finished finished product. I mean, there are drainage components and rock fall protection. And once that slope is cut, you're not going to go back up on a 200 foot high slope and install additional bolts or drainage or rock netting. So whatever, as you're excavating that, is that phase one powerhouse or phase two powerhouse slope that is being excavated, it needs to be excavated and done to what the finished support drainage protection system is. Indeed, that's true. I think the concern there, Chris, was that about the choice of the right subcontractor or was that about design development changing after excavation started? No, it was a transfer of risk and liability for the most part. I mean, at least that's how I looked at it. But I mean, there's also a value in, say, doing the phase two powerhouse platform excavation with the phase one powerhouse platform excavation. Why? Because once you've got phase one operated, it's an operating plant. Now you have construction in the axis in front of it to get to the phase two and pull and shoot down that slope and everything that goes on and on with that is impacting your phase one powerhouse. So that is... Yeah, I think it's always been... If there is a surface excavation, will be done simultaneously. So, Chris, when we were talking about this earlier on, the way I would see this, they would have to do the design and do the construction supervision. We changed the scope is what I'm getting at. I don't think this is the best way to do it. Like do the road over here that's an independent scope. And when it's an integrated scope, you got to reshuffle who's actually doing it. So I'm agreeing a thousand percent with you, but the earlier, what we're trying... Those critical path and near critical path scopes, we want to start them earlier. And the designs for some of these, i.e. an excavation with slope stability is a much less timely design. Once we get the geotech pieces, then integrating the powerhouse with the OEM and the final HVAC systems with all the loads and the pieces, right? Those come later, but we don't need that design package till months later in the process. We need these and that's where... And if it came to it, Chris, it may sound a little bit, I guess, rough and ready, but laying the slope back by another 10, 20 feet or laying the slope angle back by another few degrees. If that's a more conservative design, then doing that all at the same time as in that early period, I think you would still end up... There'd be greater quantity than perhaps you might need, but you're still saving on critical path. So it's not 18 months anymore, but let's call it 14 months or 15 months. And I think that's a significant saving across the piece, especially as we get into all the details in a moment with the OEM and the interfacing that will come when they come on board. So there are certainly ways of refining it while, I guess, keeping the intent and refining it in a way to manage those risks and manage those risks by the people that are appropriate to manage them as well. Yeah, and so I guess we specifically haven't fully defined what's in the early civil works and what's in the main civil works because of this exact reason. And Chris and I had many discussions about this and knew that there's going to be things that it makes more sense to have you guys start at the same time or start soon after they do, or you guys do the whole scope. But until we have, I guess, spoiler alert, but that's part of the reason why we asked you for the preliminary execution plan so that we could start finalizing that and say, okay, well, this is your plan and then this is your competitor's plan. And then we'll make a decision at that point. We're targeting later this year to say, okay, this is what we think, but this is what we are going to include in the civil works package that we're also going to get competitive pricing for. And then everything else is in your guys' scope. So we all define that. It's just too early to- And just, I guess, Chris, to follow on to your comment earlier, you were talking about various different surface excavations, and I guess the intent here is not kind of the thin end of the wedge to open up doing all surface excavation sooner. I think this is a very pointed part of the schedule, which is the critical path. And it's really focusing on that prioritization of the critical path. And so if there is a fear about that kind of flowing through all of the elements of the job, that wasn't the intent. It was, this is biggest bang for the book by making what is a very simple change we felt. I think one of the things that we did put in the preliminary construction execution plan was if you have your early works packages, which are the main roads and the bridge and some of the other gingerbread that goes along with getting out there, there's also early work civil works. And if we're assigned FNTP next year, we've already given you the model to go build that. So we may peel packages out either ahead of or parallel to the early works contractor doing all of that other stuff so we can facilitate expediting our work. And that's really the point. It'd be great if we built three models.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wash Bridge and some of those other roads but it's not critical. Does that make more sense? The good news is we're having this discussion about there's a lot of opportunity to move forward and not looking at it saying so from a setting up the schedule from an estimate standpoint and building it and that's why I want to say it's conservative but it it's the right approach since we were in the initial estimate of what's the impact with it because we're not debating oh my gosh this is too tight this does not work it's here's these abilities to go pull certain scopes in on this I could just shed the shining light on on this we're having what can we pull in because there actually is a real opportunity to pull it in rather than say this is starting too early that's not even feasible that type discussion. So that was it on the powerhouse we would focus when we're developing our our next stage right now of task four and six essentially we're looking at all these near critical paths at a more finite level in the schedule to sequence it lay at how many resources quantum because the other part is you have early work you have multiple people on a roadway which trucks are are heading where how many times those are some of the reasons I like with this why we were talking about the spoils like all these pieces are compounded just explain what our thought process was in the few weeks that we looked at this that's why as we have more spots we're not all fumbling over possibly the same same locations to place things we would go look to start doing work stuff at a reservoir and if we can't get things in which we've done on other jobs is bringing dozers in and dropping them with helicopters in to start getting works locally dropping cubes of fuel doing those things and then getting some production while people build roads but we're not sitting idle to waiting till it's all done it costs a little more but you can get months of advancement to be able to do some things like that. So I guess just to reiterate the powerhouse is the critical path and it really is driven by the depth of the structure the civil structure there is quite deep for a powerhouse and that really drives getting the structure built and handed over to the OEM so that the OEM can install and get the commissioning and I guess I'm teaching folks what they already know but that's the premise I guess of where this one comes from. As we were reviewing the schedule there appear to be a number of kind of measures or activities that the OEM and the main civil works are being undertaken concurrently so I kind of termed it that it's not a really clean handover from the main civils to the OEM and I can kind of understand why or second guess the reasons why and I think that was to focus on what I just mentioned to drive to get the OEM in to get the OEM works underway and get them ready to power on units one and two at the very least. And it's not entirely clear whether a lot of these measures are included within TMA and it's not entirely clear whether these measures are entirely included within the estimate. Matt will touch upon some of those at the moment but it is a concern because it's not very well documented within the sequence the handovers and the activities that will be undertaken especially mitigations that that might have to be accepted or accommodated by the OEM and certainly some of these are a little unusual for my experience with talking to the OEMs. One of those examples for instance would be the permanent gantry crane so in the sequence at the moment the permanent gantry crane is installed over shaft one powerhouse one and prior to the completion of the civils installation the civils at the base of the pit. Now is that achievable? Yes it's achievable we can put in place the structural framing for the trestles we can put in put on board the gantry crane rails that run alongside the shafts and get the main slow EOT crane installed over the shaft itself. All that is doable and it can be ready for the OEM to do whatever they need to do. The sequencing of that is done in the open air which again slightly unusual for me but it's not beyond the wit of man we can do that but also it puts in place restrictions when we're running tower cranes to place formwork from the top down into the base of the shaft rebar and just servicing people concrete and stuff and things into the shaft. It's all a restriction if we have to work around those permanent works installations that would normally come a little bit later in the schedule so that might have an impact on as well as productivity and safety and quality of us being able to do what we need to do in the bottom of the shaft. What you see on the screen it's not very easy to read but if you just kind of follow the colours the green is a representation of the schedule that's put forward in TM8 and that's kind of the sequence that's been developed. We work through what is a perhaps more conventional powerhouse construction where predominantly the civil structure is built prior to the installation of the crane and the structure towards the end and then handover of the OEM towards the end. What does that mean? As we structured this one out or sequenced it out there would be a minor impact onto the installation of the OEM rotor but it does take away a number of the I guess risks and constraints about all of that concurrent working in and around the top of the shaft. So I guess it really reinforces some of the discussions earlier. I think Boris mentioned, Will mentioned about you know interfacing with the OEM. Certainly we need to build up some key milestone dates with the OEM so this handoff to them is clear to them and then back to us is clear to us and probably need to detail that out a bit. So those milestone definitions become quite important because the work area at the top of the shaft, bottom of the shaft and the condition of the service bay whether it will be temporarily protected in a partially completed building or whether it's indeed encapsulated in the full complete building all needs to be detailed out so that when we get to developing the estimate at the end of the LNTP it is robust and there's no surprises that come along later. So it just really reinforces that there's probably a little bit more detail that we need to go through in developing those interface milestones and definitions. Do you have a gut feel on your clean handover approach out and in with civil works and OEM what that does to the powerhouse schedule? So the sequence there on the screen shows four months delay or four months deferment of rotor install. It's the very line at the very bottom of the sheet and there's a quirk in the schedule Chris that says it's actually I think a 13 month delay on rotor install but the rotor seems to sit in the service bay for a number of months so actually if you looked at timing that at the right point it's only a kind of four months delay. Are we finished? No I don't think we are finished because I think if we were able to define some of those milestones that could probably be brought in somewhere close to where it is but on the very quick look that we did in the time that we had but four months is what we currently worked on. This shows the main civils doing more work before the OEM is doing it. The interface doesn't go away right otherwise you have your rotor assembly happening you know on the green down here in October 2029 and none of this civil works is done in the window before for the whole shaft so they're doing rotor assembly and we're doing everything else in the pit all on top of each other and there's kind of the difference to it we're trying to do more of the structure build it out before the OEM gets there otherwise we're working on top of each other in the same spot. And I think that's different we have changed the scope of supply for you guys and the OEM that compared to this well yeah the schedule frankly but more stuff you guys are supplying in yours and more stuff that there's a problem there still so obviously I don't expect you guys to have an answer for that because we just set that up like last week or the week before. That will be one thing moving forward that I've told I just want you guys to look at incorporated this but and I guess if there is feedback that you guys can provide saying and it makes more sense to have them working on top of them instead of us working on top of them and things like that for those scopes we would definitely be open to that that feedback but yeah just wanted to bring that up sorry just for my information which document was that captured in the division document name was the division of responsibility between civil and OEM correct yeah but I think in this case the issue is the rotor right so I the rotors the easy one to measure Louis I think and the DOR we've kind of done an indicative an initial look sorry at the DOR and I think it's still these issues still remain in that so yeah what I've looked at is the rotor and that is the one that really panics me now because because I say any discussions that we've had with OEMs would not have us bringing in the rotor and installing it in what appears to be a partially finished building with what would need to have some temporary weatherproofing to protect the OEM build up what is a very sensitive piece of equipment so yes that's ultimately my concern the I've got a secondary concern that I don't know what we don't know right now and that probably falls through other milestone definitions that we also need to work through so you know things like understanding the actual sequence of works how many people the OEM will be bringing in is it all four units at the same time that's being worked upon is it two units and then two units all of that will help us sequence our work in a way to facilitate that but I appreciate because of the the processes that we're going through that might not be the easiest thing to detail out but that's where I'd like to get to by the end of the LNTP but your question was quite simple yeah my main concern today is the rotor install and getting that in and commenced I guess to maybe just comment on that we are doing that and we're outlining milestone dates between you guys and the OEM for construction for commissioning and all that so that we can then say hey this is the requirements for both sides to make sure we're all on the same page going into the the FNTP so we are doing that that's a time-consuming process so probably at end of the summer as is the kind of time before I'll have those outlined but one I guess maybe fundamental question they're going to come to you guys to rig and make the picks regardless right and they're not going to they're not going to say hey we want to be rigging above you guys right so if you guys are doing the rigging does it really matter and that that just may be my maybe we wouldn't be rigging the turbine for instance certainly that's not the way that I read the DOR at the moment so and the spiral case for example I don't think we're down for rigging that right now so in theory the my reading in the DOR Spencer would have the OEM bringing in a crawler crane sit next to the crawler crane that we have servicing the concrete so that they can pick and lift the spiral case elements in that was my understanding of the DOR yeah I maybe I misarticulated that so we want the onus it's a risk shifting mechanism we want the onus for I guess liability to be you guys and the way if they come to you guys hey you're there doing the rigging there's no point in us bringing up the crane um and then there's a discussion that I've had that seems like the logical thing that they that they were thinking but that may just be something we need to coordinate with so um that I guess to your point I think you're answering the question now that's that's not your guys that's not what you've seen in the past is that what you're saying so so certainly yeah we we have lifted in uh or we plan to lift in draft tubes and spiral cases with with our craniage because we have the craniage there when those need to go in at the point that the the rotor um or the turbine or any of the other elements go into the service bay to be built up um that will be down to the OEM uh and the OEM would operate the permanent entry crane at that point in time that's their equipment their best place to do that we we can do it but they will be the best place in my view to do that and that's certainly the discussion that we've had with vendors recently there's two parts not to dwell on it long but one there is the rigging plan designing calculations they would have to do all that because they know their center of gravity they know all their pieces to it they would propose something we figure out what spreaders what slings what pieces with then they would first find the backboard not on a turbine but working with OEMs on pieces with it but they have their detailed design for the details we don't we don't have it so we would then recheck their stuff from the data that we have for example see if they're picked points everything looks logical for the pieces to it and then would we give you those point implement so it's kind of a two-phase approach first it's what's the design and the calculus for the picking they have to always do that first because they have the details for it they know where their eyelets are they know where they're they should know all those things then we figure out what is the best way how to do the equipment and then to your point of okay how are we transferring the liability with the exposure if an event happens in it not from a risk of the project necessarily standpoint but from a risk of the LNTP and one of the biggest probably challenges during the LNTP phase right here is the fact of how the structure is the two OEMs we're very much in these kind of things we're talking directly to them saying how many people how are you setting up what kind of power do you need what kind of auxiliary supports do you need we have this you have that and there's a lot a lot a lot of dialogue without just you know some points of here's some inputs and here's some dates for pieces and that's why I'm saying it as a challenge standpoint in the LNTP in in our kind of internal LNTP risks register piece it's one of the biggest things in how do we get to the finish of the LNTP to do this right because it's going to affect the design it's not just the design it's how do we build all this without actually talking the same language to one another and we're going you know that they don't sorry the telephone game back and hoping that what we told it went back to Luis you know and company so I don't know the best way to do it I just want to re-flag it and how we do it because there will be lots of these were a lot of times we would just sit in a room and workshop it all day and start to talk and then figure more of it out and every time you ask a question the answer you have 10 more new questions followed right behind it and and so I just raise it as how we get that as a challenge it's hard for us to answer some of these because it really depends on what some of the thoughts are on that side of the table and vice versa they're going to be needing similar things yeah no I'm interested\n",
      "\n",
      "Just maybe as a side comment, we did discuss this in the early interviews. Potentially rolling OEM in under maintenance will likely save you a lot of trouble by trying to coordinate that. We're trying to handle that from contract means, but yes, I think we're aware. To be honest, we just don't want the added fee that's going to come on top of doing it. Then you only have a finger to point in one direction. Anyways, yeah. Anything else on this slide, Neil? No, I think I've labored enough. I'm good. Okay, my turn. Everything Neil just said is going to cost some money. That's the bottom line of this slide, but in all seriousness, there is going to be some integration and coordination with the OEM. We know they're going to need some help. We don't know what that is, so we can't price it yet, but eventually as we get through this process, that'll all get fleshed out and we'll be able to put the right amount of money in there so this thing gets all flanged up at the end of the day. The other thing here is just overall concrete productions. I broke it into two items here. There's the shaft lining, which is the picture you see on the top right. Sorry, that's an 80-foot shaft. I thought it was a 30-foot shaft. Then the OEM-related work. Obviously, the OEM-related work is slower. That absolutely makes sense. We just don't think it's slower enough. You'll see the most recent relevant productions we've got for that type of work is five or six job hours a cubic yard higher. Is that readily applicable here? It's the closest we've got for right now. I'd say that the second biggest to your prior question, Chris, on a percentage basis is in here. The quantities are not enormous. Again, there's a lot of concrete, but it's not a tremendous amount. This is a concern. It's not a humongous needle mover. Then Neil already talked about the overlap in coordination with the OEM work. There is not only the work going on on surface preparing all the high-end fancy mechanical equipment while we're working in one shaft. We're also sinking in line in the other shaft at the same time right next door. That's going to slow everybody down a little bit, so we've got to get that coordinated properly. Then what's not readily apparent in the estimate in and of itself is the allowance for embedments, anchor bolts, all the other little blockouts things that are going to be required to get the OEM access to their work. Questions on that? Yeah, just one quick thing. I guess I've got to talk to Stantic and Chris and Don before I share it, but we do have a sequential bar graph and timeline on how we've envisioned the OEM through the installation that we could possibly share with everybody. More detail on what's in TM8? Was this MTM8? I don't know if it was or not. It was in a presentation. I've learned something very similar to that. I don't think it was in TM8. It's not in TM8. It was somewhere else. It was in a presentation that we saw. That's just conceptual. Conceptual, yeah. That's not the TM8 schedule. That's just kind of showing how. But I guess it at least gives details in terms of how many units we plan to install. I guess with how we're envisioning it. Yeah, and we can share that. It's just more logic than schedule. When the excavation is going down, when the lining is coming up, when different units are being assembled, when they're being installed, and stuff like that. But yeah, we can. If that provides value to you guys, let us know. I'd be interested to read that for sure. Do you need another thought for that, Chris? Sure, otherwise I'll forget. Okay, so I think Christophe is up next. He's going to talk about some powerhouse improvements. All right. Next. Oh, that's not me. Sorry. That's Bert first. Okay, so there's three VI options that we quickly want to discuss. The first one is the PH7, which is really the long and the short of it. It's trying to bring the two bits closer to each other. Why? Because it saves on the overall length of the powerhouse, the overall civil excavation that needs to happen to create that platform at 2050. And, you know, there's obviously some savings in that. Now, my learner to technical colleague that disappeared on us will definitely say, yeah, there's a little bit of analysis that needs to be done to maintain the rock pillar between the two bits and ensure the stability of that. But if we can bring the two bits closer to each other, there's potentially some savings that can be derived from that. Okay, a lot of benefits and drawbacks. I won't necessarily go through all of them, but you understand the concept is to try and facilitate cost savings there. Yeah, it's really just to look at the spatial review and the layout of the powerhouse. Make sure that all the equipment find the space and the right level at which it needs to be installed. Those two schematics, there's just examples, one around the runner and all the mechanical cabinets. It may not be that clear to see, but that's got to go around the runner at that level, electrical. It's basically the whole electrical mechanical layout that needs to happen. And the schematic on the right is really a whole unit disassembly. And where all the parts go and make sure that we can accommodate the staging of a unit assembly or a unit disassembly. I mean, Stantec's done a great job in putting the equipment in the pit style powerhouse. The question is, do we really need 30 feet high mezzanine levels for some of the equipment? And this plays a little bit into Chunk Beach as well, where in Chunk Beach we've got 75 feet less pit. So we do reduce the number of mezzanines potentially, but then just look at each mezzanine and figure out what water equipment needs to be located on the mezzanines. I mean, I understand that the VSI equipment does need a high mezzanine. It's big, big equipment, but the rest doesn't need an electrical cabinet, doesn't need a 30 foot high mezzanine level to go on. It's stuff like HPUs and how high above the MIV they can be located. Are they draining or is everything pump circulated to the MIV machine itself, et cetera, et cetera. Next slide there is also similar to PH7, but this one is a little bit more focused on the main floor of the powerhouse. Now, if we can reduce the space between the two, if we can reduce the spacing between the two pits, it does potentially impact the staging area, the loading bay area. And just having a look at that and ultimately for an owner like you yourself, and we think smarter about the staging of, I believe the current 30% design carries a two unit disassembly or assembly in that area, but you will likely never be in that position ever again. So, it's during the installation part, make it quite comfortable to assemble one unit or disassemble one unit and potentially use some of the space on the end walls for the second unit or find alternative covered spacing as we have covered space that we just kind of discussed where the second unit could be assembled or disassembled. Just to echo that point, I think even in first install, I think from our discussions with the OEM, it will be a little bit of a stretch if they're planning to do two units at the same time. So, any early feedback that that is a hard and fast requirement from the OEMs in their discussion, in your discussions, Lewis, that will be useful because obviously it plays out to rationalizations now and in the future for you guys. And this is really the whole powerhouse, erection bay, main floor optimization. And it doesn't mean the OEM, there's not parts of the units that they may want to assemble simultaneously, but all two units assembly is very unlikely in our opinion. But we could potentially facilitate it on the end walls, you know, the other side of the pits, not necessarily between the two pits, if the second unit needs to be assembled. Yeah, we have an issue there with the crane bridge. I fully appreciate that. No, no, just you brought it up. I'm glad you brought the crane up because I actually think that we could potentially narrow up the superstructure with some optimization in the crane approach limits, the picking envelope approach limits to the side through the support column. We went through that with the supplier. So, that is why we have that step. We will review and see how we can optimize that. Yeah, you do. It's only 225, but... We go with chunk bridge and we cut 35 of it. Yeah, maybe a dumb question. I don't understand the difference between this one and PH7. PH7 is really to see if we can optimize the pit-to-pit spacing, reduce it. Yes, it does impact that area for the lay-down area, but PH9 is really to optimize the lay-down area and potentially look at other sides of the pit as well for staging of a second unit and just focus on at least one full unit assembly and disassembly and the lay-down staging area. They're really similar. That's why we try to talk about them together because they're tied together. This is one question. Does this work during the assembly and the pieces? And then, converse this area to the platform in 3-mile. I understand it right, but that central location in chunk is giving us some lateral space outside of this footprint that's at a beneficial level where it's not when you're in 3-mile where you're stacked like this and you start to fall off. That's part of the other reason that there may be some opportunity to utilize on the one side, let's say, towards the center. When you're in 3-mile, it doesn't exist. It just isn't there the way the configuration is on a topography. That is stress analysis. You have to do really that, by the way, the separation of the pits. That was based on an analysis of the stress. It depends on the one. Alina brought that up with us yesterday. This may not be the way. And it may be different between the two pits because the one is in the fault affected zone and the other one is not. I get your comment. It's a BI option that we want to basically take. You can bring them together if the stresses can take it and you don't need to have extra support and all of that stuff, all of those things. You have to look at the direction, the sequencing and the separation in the schedule. So the concern of the stability of the pits, if that doesn't work, then this just doesn't work at all. And that's why the question of in the parameters we can get, like, if this will work for the OEMs, then we can do that check to say that it's feasible. And the answer may, like we just said, not because of structural reasons, but if there's a hard and fast requirement, i.e. the OEM requirements, then we don't. And I want to address the issue of the grate because we went through that so long. And they had to modify it for this kind of very few of these characteristics. And we could not get them to reach that. It's so big that we are only, you have the limitation there of the peak. It was, I mean, the drums have to be rotated sideways. Typically, your pulley moves over the crane rail, yeah. Limits, the big limit to the sidewall there. Okay. And that dimension is typically bigger than on the two sidewalls, yeah. You can narrow it up depending on your crane configuration. And that's really what we want to try and do is to try and squeeze the parallels narrower. The superstructure, not necessarily the foot, the superstructure. To still be able to maintain the peaks, but reduce the structure worth overall. And it may not be earth shattering, but it's optimization that needs to happen. Every million counts. That's what I was going to say. We're starting to, and these are, that's why these are later in the day. Because these are, we're starting, these are smaller bikes, but trying to give us requirements to say yes, or you can or can't do them. It's both of them. Okay, I'm done. We'll just go. And this one is RF513. That's the latest one. It's about these ideas here. It's, you know, Christoph's talking to this one. So the concept is, instead of going for long access tunnels, both for powerhouse access and then construction access, we'd like to replace that with a shaft and a shorter access. Again, this is all independent of the TBM option. And the trunk beach is just the philosophy, trying to understand what is acceptable or not. To eliminate a lot of excavation, reduce schedule, and improve efficiency and ventilation. So this just shows what would be eliminated in gray. And then next page. So we would have about 100-foot diameter shaft on top left, and then access tunnels that get exactly to the same location as originally planned. The disadvantage is, yes, we would need to lift the pipe vertically down the shaft first. But then the savings are quite extensive. This brings more of an overall concept that we're trying to understand is, what are the exact needs for that PAT? And we send an RFI on that. Do we need this for ventilation only? Do we need this for construction only? Or do we need this also to bring vehicles down in the permanent condition? And right now, the PAT has a requirement for minimum radius of 100-foot radius. And if we brought\n",
      "\n",
      "this vehicle access through that ramp, we'd like to reduce that to something that is FHWA approved or similar and that would bring us to a 100-foot shaft. Or do you even need a vehicle at all? That's the question, yes. Do you only need it for ventilation in or personnel egress? The ramp there is only for access, not to bring equipment or it's just access? Well, the reason it's 100 is 100-foot it's it so we can actually drive a vehicle as Christoph, I'm pointing at the screen Christoph, to actually drive a vehicle. If we only need the shaft to drop down our manifold elements, we don't need a 100-foot shaft to go do that. We would do a smaller shaft to meet ventilation requirements and then still could be multi-purposed for personnel egress, but you don't need it to be able to handle a vehicle. That was my question, yes. You could not transport anything in there, those are so big. No, no, we wouldn't do that, but we wouldn't do it that big even if we only have to move people or ventilation. So number one, it's for ventilation. Yeah. Number two, the size of it, you know, has two different sizes. Obviously the bulk of it was enlarged because in our construction sequence we were planning to get the large sections of the manifold down there, but if those sections of the manifold aren't being brought through that tunnel, then the tunnel diameter can be reduced. Yeah. We're still, we can come up with a clarification on what the design vehicle would be, but I think the intention was that it would still be used, particularly during outage and other major maintenance activities, to have the flexibility to bring a flatbed type truck down to the operating floor level because, you know, the reach of that crane is, you know, like 300 feet. So bringing equipment other than stuff that you're going to push on a trolley or a handcart down to the operating floor level and tying up that crane with those lifts isn't probably the most efficient. I thought that there was a lift corridor that was bigger inside of there. So you can reach every floor through the shafts. You can access everything through the shaft. That's the way we laid out. So yeah, that would be what we thought once we had the tunnel there for ventilation and also needed that to drive, go down to the manifold. Okay, it's there. We can use it for emergency grass. We can use it for ventilation. We can use that for also bringing equipment if we have to now to the maintenance. That was basically the criteria for that. Now, the question is now, we have something like this. That's amazing. My question is, do you even, do you need this because you want to drive in? There's other lifts, you know, that you can actually drive a lift, drive a vehicle right into a lift and let it down. The question is, what do you really need the vehicle for if you're at the pit level, if you're at the pit location and you offload something and it's big enough to hit that same thing. You have a 30 foot by 11 foot slot, which is bigger than any flatbed truck. You're talking about now in the power speed, the elevators, having the freight and the truck. Correct. That, you know, if that's the question of what do you really, this is what we just don't understand. What do you really need the vehicle for? Because the same thing that you can drive down on a flatbed vehicle, you can take down within the pit itself and you can stop at every floor that you'd ever need at. Where this is just going to come down to one spot. So it really comes back to what is the, in an operating world, not the construction. Defining the requirements. What do you really want? And then we can size this to make it probably more faster and less costly than digging those long, long tunnels. This is provided you don't have a schedule issue with this configuration of bringing the cans and bringing all the bifurcations through the shaft and that short term, right? Well, we have to handle it twice because we have to take it from horizontal to vertical to horizontal. Yes. But we have to take it in the same 30-foot, you know, diameter from the initial thing with one lift the whole way and drive it in and out. Yeah. It is likely that the means of transportation from the fabrication to the beginning of the tunnel, whether it's a shaft or a portal, will be different than in the tunnel where it will be very specific anyway. So it needs to be transferred. And then if you say, Chris, you want to drive a flatbed in there, that means it's a quite considerable load, then you still have to offload it and handle it horizontally to wherever you need it at that level. That's why we're just, yeah, I think action is for us just to find what maintenance requirements we'll need from that access. We can take a look at that with the other maintenance folks. For construction, we need to figure out how big we need to sit, but not worry if there's an additional stipulation for operations. We have projects where the HUNA specify in the elevator, I have to take X, Y, and Z down. Now, then it's not a typical commercial elevator. It becomes an industrial type of elevator, and that's fine. That's another piece of equipment to maintain. Elevators never break down. No, you've got the bridge crane installed. We'll discuss it. We can provide some more clarification. It's a matter of preference. I think that the circular ramp is not that complicated to build. We just need to have a criteria of what kind of a vehicle would need to go through there. Because right now, the 100-foot radius, I don't know exactly where it comes from, and that would be much more challenging. We would need to do a 200-foot shaft minimum. Yeah, we can do that. Thank you. All right. This one is a quick one. Another VI option where we investigated how to get the manifold installed. This option basically proposed a lateral access in one or maybe more of the manifold legs or along one of the manifold legs be able to install otherwise on the ground from inside the pit. Now, it does complicate the pit usage a little bit, but it's an option that would eliminate some of the other tunnel access issues. We still have to size the tunnel for a larger manifold Y that basically goes on the leg one. This is something that we also, I guess, need to confirm if there's any future owner requirements to have permanent access like man access. Just kidding. I mean, typically not, but if there's any particular requirement to go and inspect Ys or vary it. I don't grasp the concept here. Can you explain that? Instead of having an access tunnel, you bring it down through the shaft, the manifold down through the shaft, and then bring it forward, right? Take it laterally into it. So, you mean you're opening that entire on the... Yeah. So, you can't bring it down here. You bring the manifold down and then you take it in instead of bringing it in from that tunnel. Okay. So, structurally, you're going to break that brink. We are having a lot of problems just perforating that concrete shell for a tunnel of 16 feet. So, it requires all kinds of reinforcements. So, you basically... I understand the reinforcing required, but the crotch blade is obviously the biggest biggest chunk of steel that you've got to convey into the tunnel. And whether you weld it in situ with all the quality control that needs to happen and whether you weld it on surface or get it transported to site one piece, you still got to get it in. And all this option proposes is to lower it in, lower it down a bit, and boil it sideways. But this is used for new temporary works. This is used for construction means and methods. Everything would be backfilled with concrete and replaced as if it was real rock. We're getting them. These are the lower, lower, lower. That is by no means the largest bifurcator. The biggest one is over there. So, that's why it's going all the way there. And then you work your way towards something. Okay. And it means in Memphis, okay. Yeah. And if we have to really... And we've not laid this out in the schedule, the timing, where's the pit, where's the rest of the work within the powerhouse with it. This one will take more bedding. But to your point, it is a means and method. It's not changing. A design decision from a... Powerhouse being the critical part. And we are concerned with that. Somebody change that briefly. All right. So, yeah, that completes the powerhouse section. I think there was one constructability component that we wanted to touch on briefly with the powerhouse, but didn't get to, was just looking at the access roads through the wash area and the ability to turn around large construction vehicles within the staging areas and the way it's laid out or to be able to get the equipment, large equipment, delivered to the places they need to be. We have a little bit of concern about that layout. And if it looks a little tight, we have to back up a truck. It's very tight. Yeah. So, we do have one value improvement option that we're not presenting today, but it's AR2 that kind of proposes a way to extend some of the staging area that would help with that. It's similar to what STANTEX proposes before. You can look at it in the document, but we don't have any presentation slides on it today. Okay. So, then, yeah, moving into access roads and site facilities, we're going to tee it off over to Glenn. You just have one thing to talk about. Talk about access roads. Yeah. So, this will be pretty quick. We've hit it on a little bit. The first thing, there's two elements to this. One is just reducing the slopes on the roads to as close to 10% as we can. There's two areas that give us concern from safety and logistics. So, the concept here is to add some switchbacks and to help flatten the slopes 3 to 4% so we can get a little bit closer to 10% on grade to help out with access. The other thing that this allows us to do is in these corners, these are locations that either have existing spoil areas or could be existing spoil areas. Or new spoil areas. So, it gives us a little bit more accessibility to drop more materials and it aligns with the spoil plan that we saw earlier. So, this would be the first one. And then, next slide, please. The second one is this concept. And we need to workshop it from what I'm hearing today is, you know, where do we widen the access roads if we have to haul out of the upper reservoir any material or haul into the upper reservoir any material from, say, Granite Mountain or Granite Quarry or even Sweetheart Peak or some of the other locations where we need additional width to allow two 777s to pass. And probably be closer to the 50, 54-foot range for new roadway access. But addressing these two concerns we have, first and foremost, let's see what we can do to lessen the slopes. And then, second, identify areas where we would need to widen these roads to accommodate construction traffic. That's it. How often do you need passing lanes? I would say anywhere you're hauling, you want 100% ability to pass. You know, turnouts are okay, but it's going to slow us down because inevitably someone will sit in a turnout and park. They won't just pull over, not like a Texas Super 2 roadway where they just can keep going. This really comes back to the rocks at the beginning just to, you know, remind. Because if we can source the material from near the reservoir, the demand here goes drastically down. If we do, the rock is not there and we're going to have to move in four and a half million cubes. We're going to need a road probably, a double road the whole way at the rate that these speed and go back and forth and to get that timing. Otherwise, we stop, go, stop, go, have challenges all the time. That's, you know, how much can we source locally versus not. Unfortunately, they're playing on each other, but that's the big factor of where it is. We don't disagree, but that's the problem of, you know, is the dam on the critical path or not? Dam can really be on the critical path if it's the big volume dam that generates the most water capacity and there's no rock available up there. Now we have a problem of how are we going to go move? In some of those cases, how are we going to move 6 million to 7 million cubes of rock? If you don't need massive amounts of material up to the reservoir or down out of the reservoir, what type of road widths and equipment are you looking at? So any place we don't do a 777, I think your design is fine right now with 745s and 30 feet. It's where we get into situations. If you look, if we had to haul from the Quarry Mountain to the dams, that's 16,000 feet. And in order to keep up with the productions and the schedule, which, I mean, they're hauling, but they're not bad, and you're going to need 14 trucks. So you have 14 trucks on roughly three miles of road trying to go at 10 to 12 miles an hour. And it's an insurmountable task to expect turnouts or staging or waiting or stoplights to solve that problem. You're going to have to have full width roads. The original plan with just hauling out of the interconnect to the East Dam, it's only 1,000 feet and you can get 12,000 yards a day with six to seven trucks. So that's the plan. But when you pull the haul distance further away on a narrow road that you can't pass two trucks, it just won't keep up. So what we thought about doing was identifying on our drawing or sketch where we thought the roads would need to be wider to accommodate either getting to Quarry Mountain or Quarry Peak or whatever it's called, granted, to other locations we saw where we could get granted to build the dam. And although if we're not using...\n",
