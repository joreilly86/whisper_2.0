# Project Plan: Local Voice Note Transcription App

## Project Goal
Create a local voice note transcription app that can automatically transcribe meetings from audio files.

## Key Features
*   **Automatic Transcription:** The app should monitor a specific folder and automatically transcribe any new audio files saved to it.
*   **Long-form Transcription:** The app needs to handle long audio files (2-3 hours), which will require an audio chunking mechanism.
*   **Multi-participant conversations:** The app should be able to accurately transcribe meetings with multiple speakers.
*   **Language:** The initial focus is on transcribing English language audio.
*   **Post-processing:** Transcriptions should be post-processed according to a detailed prompt to ensure the desired output format.
